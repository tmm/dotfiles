# Global Agent Guidelines

## Critical Reminders

### DO NOT

- Start work if git has uncommitted changes
- Make up performance numbers or generic justifications for changes
- Commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive information
- Break existing functionality without proper testing
- Ignore linting or formatting tools when available

### ALWAYS

- Ask before committing code
- Follow project patterns and conventions
- Read relevant documentation before starting tasks
- Test changes thoroughly before committing
- Use version control best practices
- Consider security implications of changes

## Project-Specific Overrides

This file provides universal guidelines. Projects may have their own AGENTS.md file that overrides or extends these guidelines with project-specific requirements.

This file should be updated when major architectural patterns change across multiple projects.
